# Week 1: Setting Up Java

## Overview of the Java Ecosystem

Java is a complicated language---in fact, it's much more than just a language.
It's an entire ecosystem.

### The Java Language

The Java language is a specification of things that you can write, like the
statement `int x = 3;` (the details of how a language can look is called its
_syntax_), along with some rules about what writing certain stuff should _mean_
(rules determining what programs mean, i.e. what executing a program actually
does, is called the _semantics_ of the language).

Learning all the details of the Java programming language will take a lonnnng
time. But you can get a lot of it pretty quickly!

### Java is Compiled

Computers can't read high level programming languages like Java.
